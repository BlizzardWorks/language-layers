* Current solutions
** System layouts
** Transcription text entry
** Homophonic layouts
** Language-specific text editors

* Problems with current solutions

- Not easy to modify or customize if you want to do something differently
- Not homophonic; lack phonetic correspondence with English letters
- Not easy to toggle on and off

* The general idea

- Create homphonic keyboard layouts for ancient Greek and Hebrew

* TODO Outline paper more completely
